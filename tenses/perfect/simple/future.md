# Future perfect

## Form

- **statement**: `{{subject}}` + `will` + `[not]` + `have` +
  `{{verb in "past participle" form}}`
- **question**: `will` + `[not]` + `{{subject}}` + `have` +
  `{{verb in "past participle" form}}`

## Indicators

- **between `{{verb in "past participle" form}}` and `{{event in the future}}`**:
  - till
  - by

## Usage

- The main focus is an action result
- The span (is referred later as **span**) which the action was performed in
  includes either the moment in Present Simple (action in the future) **or**
  time in the future, which serves as a **span** end
- **span** must be specified explicitly:  
  **e.g.**: I will have done this drawing *by the time Jane comes*.
