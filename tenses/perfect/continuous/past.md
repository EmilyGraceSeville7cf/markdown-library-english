  includes either the moment in Past Simple **or** time in the past, which
  serves as a **span** end
- **span** must be specified explicitly:  
  **e.g.**: I had been working for 2 hours *before my phone rang*.
- **duration** can be specified either explicitly **or** or being omitted:  
  **e.g.**: I had been working for *2 hours* before my phone rang.

  **e.g.**: I had *lived* here *for* 20 years before Clara moved in.
