## Usage

- The main focus is an action duration (is referred later as **duration**) while
  the result of the action is visible
- The span (is referred later as **span**) which the action was performed in
  includes either the moment in Present Simple (action in the future) **or**
  time in the future, which serves as a **span** end
- **span** must be specified explicitly:  
  **e.g.**: I will have been writing C# for 2 hours *by the time Jane comes*.
- **duration** can be specified either explicitly **or** or being omitted:  
  **e.g.**: I will have been writing C# for *2 hours* by the time Jane comes.  
  **e.g.**: I will have been writing C# by the time Jane comes.

## Overrides

- **use [Future Perfect](../simple/future.md)** with stative verbs with `for | since`:
  **e.g.**: I will have *lived* here *for* 20 years by next Monday.
